#  #2 Good Book: Clean Code

I want to bring you attention to an excellent book about the “craft of programming”. It is called “Clean Code” by Robert C Martin. Actually this book is a collaboration of a number of authors who contributed to make a set of rules to live by when coding. I have to say that all the rules they give make a whole lot of sense, one of the best, and most sensible collections of coding rules I have seen in many years. It covers guidelines for code structure, vertical and horizontal formatting, variable naming, class structure, method structure, data structure, test driven development, and many more topics.  

I strongly recommend that if you are interested in learning the most recent, well accepted principles in the programming craft, please read this book for guidance. It will help the quality of our projects tremendously.

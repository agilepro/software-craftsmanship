title: AgileTribe New Format
---

Welcome to the newly reformatted AgileTribe site.  Hope you like the new presentation.

I have transferred all the content from a Word Press blog, into a Docusaurus site.  This should make all of the information more organized and easier to get to.  Instead of just a linear blog, there is a subject tree on the left which gives an overview of the topic which are then organized by category.  All the same content is still there, it is just organized in a way that is easier to see and find.

Also, the formatting of the content is much easier in Docusaurus since it is based entirely on markdown, which is both powerful, but at the same time devoid of the quirks of formatting that I ran into on WordPress.  Markdown helps particularly with the code examples which are colored according to the syntax of a wide variety of programming languages.

Hope you like the new presentation.
